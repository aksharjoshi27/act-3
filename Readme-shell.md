# Analytics in Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform (MIDP) DREAM Demo DREAM Demo in a Box Setup Guide

## What is it?
DREAM Demos in a Box (DDiB) are packaged Industry Scenario DREAM Demos with ARM templates (with a demo web app, Power BI reports, Synapse resources, AML Notebooks etc.) that can be deployed in a customer’s subscription using the CAPE tool in a few hours.  Partners can also deploy DREAM Demos in their own subscriptions using DDiB.

 ## Objective & Intent
Partners can deploy DREAM Demos in their own Azure subscriptions and show live demos to customers. 
In partnership with Microsoft sellers, partners can deploy the Industry scenario DREAM demos into customer subscriptions. 
Customers can play,  get hands-on experience navigating through the demo environment in their own subscription and show to their own stakeholders.

<!-- /TOC -->

## Requirements

* An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace.
* A Power BI Pro or Premium account to host Power BI reports.
* Make sure you are the Power BI administrator for your account and service principal access is enabled on your Power BI tenant.
* Make sure the following resource providers are registered with your Azure Subscription.
   - Microsoft.Sql 
   - Microsoft.Synapse 
   - Microsoft.StreamAnalytics 
   - Microsoft.EventHub 
   - Microsoft.Media.MediaServices
   - Microsoft.Databricks
   - Microsoft.Kusto
* You can run only one deployment at any point in time and need to wait for its completion. You should not run multiple deployments in parallel as that will cause deployment failures.
* Select a region where the desired Azure Services are available. If certain services are not available, deployment may fail. See [Azure Services Global Availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all) for understanding target service availability. (consider the region availability for Synapse workspace, Iot Central and cognitive services while choosing a location)
* Do not use any special characters or uppercase letters in the environment code. Also, do not re-use your environment code.
* In this Accelerator we have converted Real-time reports into static reports for the ease of users but have covered entire process to configure Realtime dataset. Using those Realtime dataset you can create Realtime reports.
* Please ensure that you select the correct resource group name. We have given a sample name which may need to be changed should any resource group with the same name already exist in your subscription.
* The audience for this document is CSAs and GBBs.
* Please log in to Azure and Power BI using the same credentials.
* Once the resources have been setup, please ensure that your AD user and synapse workspace have “Storage Blob Data Owner” role assigned on storage account name starting with “stretail”. You need to contact AD admin to get this done.
* Please review the [License Agreement](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/blob/main/CDP-Retail/license.md) before proceeding.
